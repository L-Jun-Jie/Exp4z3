# Compilation and Configuration
## Z3 Patch
Since some of the code in Z3 was modified during implementation, some of the files in Z3 need to be replaced.

Both patch files are in the folder `z3_patch`, just copy them to replace the original files in `z3/src/smt/`.

The above work needs to be done before compiling Z3.
